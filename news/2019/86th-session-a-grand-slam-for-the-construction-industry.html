              <p>After meeting for 140 days at the Capitol, Texas Legislators adjourned the 86th Legislative Session on May 27th, 2019. For
                  the construction industry as a whole, many are saying that the 86th Legislative Session was one of the most productive in
                  recent memory. Several “construction-related” bills which had been worked on for numerous sessions ultimately passed the
                  finish line and were signed in to law by Governor Greg Abbott in 2019. This was in large part due to the collaborative nature
                  of the legislative session and the hard work of numerous legislators. But, of course, the successes for the industry would not
                  have occurred but-for the dedication, expertise and toil of industry leaders, professionals, attorneys and other stakeholders.</p>

              <p>The five key bills listed below should be considered monumental legislative victories for the entire industry, creating
                  transparency, fairness and a level playing field between owners, contractors, subcontractors and all parties involved in
                  construction projects across the state of Texas. This list is by no means exhaustive, but should give you a glimpse of just how
                  successful the 86th Legislative Session was for the people and companies who are literally building Texas and making the
                  Lone Star State stronger than it already is:</p>

              <ol>
                <li><p>For starters, I was proud to author and pass into law House Bill 1999, commonly referred to as the “Right to Repair”
                        legislation. This bill amends the Texas Government Code to set out provisions relating to a claim asserted by a
                        governmental entity against a contractor, subcontractor, supplier or design professional for damages arising from
                        damage caused by an alleged construction defect in an improvement to real property that is a public building or
                        public work or for indemnity or contribution for such damages. Among other provisions, this legislation requires a
                        governmental entity to provide certain parties with a report and an opportunity to inspect and correct any construction
                        defect or related condition before bringing a legal action asserting such a claim. Further, the legislation provides for the
                        dismissal of an action brought by a governmental entity that does not comply with these requirements.</p></li>
                <li><p>House Bill 1734 by my colleague and friend, Representative Justin Holland (R, Rockwall), provides important transparency
                        measures for school districts’ use of proceeds resulting from litigation relating to defective design and construction of
                        school facilities. Aimed at cracking down on certain trial lawyers who have created cottage industries getting retained
                        by school districts to file suit against their contractors, the bill will, among other provisions, require school districts to
                        use litigation proceeds on the actual expenses that are reasonably related to the repairs which are deemed necessary,
                        instead of on unrelated expenses that may be on the school district’s wish list. This will, no doubt, reduce frivolous
                        litigation and reduce insurance costs for contractors who are performing school work in Texas.</p></li>
                <li><p>My colleague and legislative classmate, Dr. Greg Bonnen (R, Galveston), passed House Bill 2826 into law. This bill
                        drastically improves the approval process for political subdivisions of the state who are seeking to enter into contingent
                        fee contracts with private attorneys to, in many cases, sue contractors for a multitude of claims – some meritorious
                        and some meritless. The bill applies to districts, authorities, counties, municipalities, other political subdivisions of the
                        state and local government corporations or other entities acting on behalf of a political subdivision in the planning and
                        design of construction projects. Importantly, in relevant part, the legislation establishes transparency requirements and puts in place a Qualification-Based Selection system in these contingent fee contract arrangements – something that
                        will, without question, benefit the construction industry and, more important, guard against frivolous lawsuits and, in
                        doing so, protect Texas taxpayers.</p></li>
                <li><p>Further, I was proud to file and pass House Bill 2899 that relates to a contractor’s liability for the accuracy, adequacy,
                        sufficiency, suitability or feasibility of certain project specifications. Partially addressing the age-old “Lonergan” issues,
                        this bill only applies to a contract for the construction or repair of a road or highway owned or operated by the Texas
                        Department of Transportation, a regional tolling authority, a regional mobility authority, a transportation corporation,
                        or certain counties to extend or expand that road or highway. Bottom line: under the terms of this new legislation,
                        the Contractor will not be liable for any damage caused by a defect in project specifications or the errors, omissions
                        or negligent acts of a governmental entity or contracted third party entity in the rendition or conduct of professional
                        duties related to the specifications.</p></li>
                <li><p>Finally, Senate Bill 1928, by Senator Fallon (R, Frisco) specifies that the affidavit required to accompany a Certificate
                      of Merit, under Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 150.002, has to be signed by a third party professional who
                      “<em>practiced</em>” in the same area of practice as the defendant. This replaces the broad and often-confusing requirement that
                      the third party professional was <em>knowledgeable</em> in the area of practice.</p></li>
              </ol>

              <p>Again, these five bills should be considered victories for the construction industry, as a whole. While we were not able to
                  get some of our priorities over the goal-line – including lien law reforms and statute of repose revisions – those bills will, no
                  doubt, be key priorities for the industry in the 87th Texas Legislative Session. And, if that legislative session is as collaborative
                  and laser-focused as the one that just concluded, I am confident we’ll be able to celebrate once again in the summer of 2021.</p>

              <p>Until then, if you have any questions or desire more information about the above bills (or any bills that weren’t listed), or if
                  you want to discuss your own concerns or ideas for legislation, I invite and encourage you to reach out to me directly. God
                  bless the Great State of Texas!</p>
