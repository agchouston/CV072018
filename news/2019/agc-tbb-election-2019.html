              <h3>Texans to vote on 10 constitutional amendments in Nov. 5 election</h3>
              <p>Texas voters will head to the polls on Nov. 5 to decide the fate of 10 constitutional amendments, which feature issues ranging from disaster relief funding to a constitutional ban on state individual income taxes.</p>
              <p>Each proposition needs just a simple majority vote to be adopted as part of the Texas Constitution. State lawmakers proposed and passed the amendments this spring in the legislative session.</p>
              <p>One such amendment proposed by former Austin AGC Chairman Rep. John Cyrier (R-Lockhart) and Sen. Lois Kolkhorst (R-Brenham) aims to tighten up a 1993 law that directs sales tax revenue on sporting goods to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. While all funds from these taxes are supposed to help fund the parks department and historical commission, lawmakers have been able to divert these funds in the past for other issues. This proposition would ensure the money is spent as intended and will help state parks and historic sites.</p>
              <p>Other high-profile amendments include an explicit ban on state individual income taxes sponsored by Rep. Jeff Leach (R-Plano) and Sen. Pat Fallon (R-Prosper); an amendment giving temporary exemption on property taxes to property owners in areas declared affected by natural disasters; and a proposition increasing the amount the Permanent School Fund can contribute to education annually, from $300 million to $600 million.</p>
              <p>The following is a full list of the constitutional amendments that will appear on the Nov. 5 ballot. Early voting begins Oct. 21. A detailed outline of the amendments along with arguments for and against them <a href="https://hro.house.texas.gov/pdf/focus/amend86.pdf" target="_blank">can be found here.</a></p>
